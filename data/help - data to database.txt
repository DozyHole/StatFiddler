Download and open 'DB Browser for SQLite'

I will use England 2017 as example as that has been done.
select New Database
save as England/2017/db.db

for each csv file
	select File
	select Import
	select Table from CSV file...
	select England/2017/E0.csv
	select Open
	select Okay
repeat above for E1.csv, E2.csv, E3.csv and EC.csv

select Write Changes

We now have our database for England 2017 which contains all divisions
copy and paste db.db to \Unity\Assets\Data\EN
rename to 2017.bytes

That's it, we must do this for all data. Maybe just go back 5 years for each league to start with so I can see how
large app becomes, but think all leagues can be added eventually.
